# commpy
CompPy is a Python package for analyzing and designing composite 
laminates. It contains several features:
### Composite Laminate Theory
1. Construct the ABD Matrices for a composite laminate (including hybrids)
 given a layup and a material library.
2. Calculation of effective elastic constants.
3. Design a laminate to meet minimum elastic/weight properties given a
 material library. Various constraints can be applied to the ABD matrix.

### Composite Strength Theory
1. Ultimate strength calculations.
2. Hole strength calculations.
3. Design a laminate to meet minimum strength properties given a material library.

### Bonded Joint Analysis
1. Goland-Reissner Method
2. Hart-Smith Methods
